# TouchpadGestures Advanced

## What's this?

This Application was created to extend the multi-fingered gesture experience of your Precision Touchpad. 

The standard feature of Windows 10 allows users to switch foreground windows by sliding your touchpad with three-fingers to the right. This application also allows users to switch tabs within a window with similar touchpad gestures.

## What can this application do?

### Now

Dispatches Ctrl-Tab / Ctrl-Shift-Tab shortcuts by sliding your touchpad down/up with three-fingers. It won't conflict any other gestures enabled by Windows10 in Settings - Devices - Touchpad.

### In Development

Provides an additional multi-fingered experience for softwares like Chrome/Firefox that uses the extensions for this application.
